    "# Multi-Hop Architecture in Databricks\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-hop architecture is an essential concept in data engineering, particularly within data lakehouse architectures. This architecture typically consists of stages (or hops) where data is progressively refined, transformed, and moved closer to analytics or machine learning use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Databricks, this multi-hop approach leverages Delta Lake and Spark to create a robust pipeline, often organized into three major hops:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bronze (Raw)**\n",
    "- **Silver (Cleaned and Refined)**\n",
    "- **Gold (Curated and Aggregated)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each stage adds value to the data, gradually transforming it into meaningful insights for end-users and applications."
